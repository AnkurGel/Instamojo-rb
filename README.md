# Instamojo-rb
This is the **Ruby** library of [Instamojo REST API](https://www.instamojo.com/developers/rest/).
This will assist you to programmatically create, edit and delete links on Instamojo. Also supports [RAP](https://www.instamojo.com/developers/request-a-payment-api/) api for payments request, listing and status.

## Installation
`gem install Instamojo-rb`
For your Rails/bundler projects:
`gem 'Instamojo-rb'`

## Usage
### Set API keys
```ruby
require 'Instamojo-rb'
api = Instamojo::API.new do |app|
  app.api_key = "api_key-you-received-from-api@instamojo.com"
  app.auth_token = "auth_token-you-received-from-api@instamojo.com"
end
#or
api = Instamojo::API.new("api_key-you-received-from-api@instamojo.com", "auth_token-you-received-from-api@instamojo.com")
```

**Note**: If you're using this wrapper with our sandbox environment `https://test.instamojo.com/` then you should pass `'https://test.instamojo.com/api/1.1/'` as third argument to the `Instamojo` class while initializing it. API key and Auth token for the same can be obtained from https://test.instamojo.com/developers/ (Details: [Test Or Sandbox Account](https://instamojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/208485675-Test-or-Sandbox-Account)).

    api = Instamojo::API.new("api_key", "auth_token", "https://test.instamojo.com/api/1.1/")

### Generate client
`client = api.client`

### Links

`Link` object contains all the necessary information required to interpret, modify and archive an Instamojo Link. All link operations on client returns one or collectionn of `links`. Original response from Instamojo API for a link is encapsulated in `link.original`, which is immutable. Call `#to_h` on `link` to get it's all attributes.
_Helper methods_ for `Link`:
* `link.to_h` - Returns equivalent Ruby hash for a link.
* `link.to_json` - Returns equivalent JSON for a link
* `link.original` - Returns original link data fetched from API.
* `link.save` - Edits updates carried out on Link object at Instamojo.
* `link.archive` - Archives link at Instamojo
* `link.reload` or `link.refresh` - Looks for changes on Instamojo server for the link. Immutable
* `link.reload!` or `link.refresh!` - Same as `link.reload`, but mutable.

 More about it's usage is below.

#=> Array of Instamojo::Link objects
```

#### Create a new link

  link.quantity = 10
  link.redirect_url = 'http://ankurgoel.com'
  link.file_upload = '~/Pictures/RISE.jpg'
  link.cover_image = '~/Pictures/saturday.jpg'
end
#=> Instamojo Link(slug: api-link-v11, title: API link v1.1, shorturl: )
new_link.reload!
#=> Instamojo Link(slug: api-link-v11, title: API link v1.1, shorturl: http://imojo.in/1dxv1h)
